## Nordic Semiconductor nRF5 Smartwatches

Most of these watches are made by [idoosmart](http://www.idoosmart.com) and can be purchased from their [aliexpress](https://ido-smart.en.alibaba.com/productgrouplist-0/Ungrouped.html?) company site.

Be careful when purchasing from a third party reseller as there have been instances where the received watch does not contain a nRF5 chip, or you purchase a ID107HR Plus and receive a ID107HR instead.

Note : I have no affiliation with idoosmart / Shenzhen DO Intelligent Technology Co,. Ltd, nor any aliexpress or smartwatch retailer.

Included in this package:
1. [IDO003](images/IDO003_back.jpg)
2. [ID100HR](images/ID100HR_back.jpg)
3. [ID107HR](images/ID107HR_back.jpg)

I am happy to accept pull requests for any nRF51 or nRF52 based smartwatch, but will be unable to test anything except for the ID107HR (v2.4) unless you are feeling generous and want to send me one :wink:.

####Note
Im not sure about the ID100HR variant. The pin mapping has been taken from posts about the ID100HR, as well as posts on the ID107HR which appeared to have the same pin mapping.

My ID107HR is a v2.4 and it does not match the pin mapping of the ID100HR. So if you have a ID107HR that is a v2.3 or earlier you will need to use the ID100HR (at this stage).
